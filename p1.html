    <p>Did you know that hummingbirds are quite smart? They have a fantastic memory, remembering where each flower is and how to get there. <br>
       A hummingbird's brain is about 4.2% of their body weight, giving these birds the largest brain-to-body proportion of any bird. <br>
       Hummingbirds have a few other records to beat tooThe Bee Hummingbird, found only in Cuba, is the world's smallest bird. Weighing just 1.6 grams,<br>
       they are easily mistaken for bees. Their dainty eggs are around 6mm long (around the size of a coffee bean!) and are laid into tiny, cup-shaped nests made of cobwebs and moss.</p>
