    <h3>Black drongo:</h3>
    <img src="./black2.jpg"hight="300px" width="300px">
    <p>The species is known for its aggressive behaviour towards much larger birds, such as crows, never hesitating to dive-bomb any bird of prey that invades its territory. This behaviour earns it the informal name of king crow. <br>
        Smaller birds often nest in the well-guarded vicinity of a nesting black drongo.They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They sometimes fly close to <br>
        tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs.</p>
