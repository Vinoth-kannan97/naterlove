    <p>The Old World sparrows are some of the few passerine birds that engage in dust bathing. They will first scratch a hole in the ground with their feet, then lie in it and fling dirt or sand over their bodies with flicks of their wings.<br>
         They will also bathe in water, or in dry or melting snow.A house sparrow (Passer domesticus), called chiri in Punjabi and ghar ki gauraya in Hindi, is a household name. The resident bird, with a length of 16 cm, was once very common in <br>
         the Inter State Chandigarh Region (ISCR).</p>
