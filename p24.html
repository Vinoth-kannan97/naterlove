    <h3>Polar Forest:</h3>
    <img src="./polar2.jpg"hight="300px" width="300px">
    <p>polar ecosystem, complex of living organisms in polar regions such as polar barrens and tundra. Polar barrens and tundra are found at high latitudes on land surfaces not covered by perpetual ice and snow.<br>
       These areas lying beyond the tree line comprise more than 10 percent of the Earth's land surface.Polar habitats cover the top and bottom of planet Earth at the North and South Poles. The North Pole is surrounded<br>
       by the Arctic Ocean. There isn't any land here, just a group of continually shifting ice sheets. Parts of Canada and Greenland are near the North Pole. The South Pole is located on Antarctica.</p>
