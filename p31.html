    <h3>Lion:</h3>
    <img src="./lion2.jpg"hight="300px" width="300px">
    <p>Lions inhabit a wide range of habitats, from open plains to thick brush and dry thorn forest. Except for a small population of the Indian lion<br>
       subspecies that remains in the Gir Forest of northwest India, lions now live only in Africa, from the Sahara's southern fringe to northern South Africa.<br>
       Lions are the only known cat species where individuals roar together - with even young cubs joining in with their mews. The calling sequence usually lasts <br>
       about 40 seconds. A group of lions, also called 'a pride', often roar together to mark their territory - a roar can be heard from 5 miles away.</p>
