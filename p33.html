    <p>Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear).<br>
       They're found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.Fruit, nuts, honey and other plant parts are favorites of bear. They also eat insects and sometimes fish, but most of their food comes <br>
       from plants. Bears have an excel- lent sense of smell, and can easily find food using their noses.</p>
