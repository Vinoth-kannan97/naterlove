    <p>The largest of the great apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large, human-like hands, and small eyes set into hairless faces. The two gorilla species live in equatorial Africa,<br>
       separated by about 560 miles of Congo Basin forest. Each has a lowland and upland subspecies.There are two gorilla species in the world: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla. The mountain gorilla is a <br>
       subspecies of the eastern gorilla. Mountain gorillas are endangered - there are an estimated 1,063 in the wild according to the latest census results (which come out every 5-10 years).Gorillas live in the dense<br>
       forest of tropical Africa where observation of their daily life becomes extremely difficult. Despite recent successful observations of the mountain gorilla in Zaire, much of their life in the wild remains a mystery.</p>
