    <p>Where do African forest elephants live? African forest elephants inhabit the dense rainforests of West and Central Africa. Their tendency to dwell in dense forest habitats prohibits traditional <br>
       counting methods such as visual identification.The African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) is the largest living land animal. A native of various open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, males weigh<br>
       about 6.0 tonnes (13,200 lb) on average. The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in Angola in 1974.African forest elephants reach approximately 2.4–3 metres (8–10 feet) in height and can grow <br>
       to 1–3 metres (3–10 feet) in length. Their approximate weight ranges between 1,800 and 5,400 kg (between about 4,000 and 12,000 pounds; 3–6 tons).</p>
