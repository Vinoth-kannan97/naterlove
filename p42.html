    <p>Sunflowers plants display a behavior called heliotropism. The flower buds and young blossoms will face east in the morning<br>
       and follow the sun as the earth moves during the day.The Chinese associate sunflowers with long life, good luck, and happiness.<br>
       They often give these flowers as gifts on birthdays and other special occasions. In Victorian England, sunflowers symbolized <br>
       loyalty, longevity, and adoration. They were often used in floral arrangements for weddings and other celebrations.</p>
