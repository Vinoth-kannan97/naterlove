    <h3>Rose:</h3>

    <p>The Greek legends narrate how the white rose first sprang during the birth of Aphrodite, the Goddess of Purity. The association of rose with love is also a concept passed on from myths that relate <br>
        how the name of Eros, the God of Love, can be rearranged to form the word 'rose'.A rose is a plant that is a member of the genus Rosa, which consists of some 100 species of perennial shrubs in the rose<br>
        family. Many roses are cultivated for their beautiful flowers, which range in colour from white through various tones of yellow and pink to dark crimson and maroon.Their beauty, symbolism, cultural<br>
        significance, exclusivity, and association with special occasions all contribute to their appeal as a flower of love and affection. Giving someone a rose is not just a simple act of giving a flower,<br>
        but a gesture that conveys a message of love, admiration, and appreciation.</p>
